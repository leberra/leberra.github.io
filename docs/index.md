# Cloud-Native Platforms, Built for **Resilience** and **Security**

Leveraging my background in DevOps and network security, I design and build secure, high-performance cloud infrastructure that gives you confidence to innovate.

[About Me](/about){:.btn} [contact@leberra.com](mailto:contact@leberra.com){:.btn}

## My Core Services

### Secure Platform Engineering
I build production-ready Kubernetes platforms using Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) and GitOps principles. With a security-first approach, I ensure your infrastructure is not only scalable but also resilient and secure by design.

### Cloud-Native Observability  
A platform is incomplete without visibility. I implement robust observability solutions using Prometheus, Grafana, and OpenTelemetry to help you understand your systems, resolve incidents faster, and control monitoring costs.

### Cloud Cost & Performance Optimization
I specialize in analyzing and optimizing cloud infrastructure and data pipelines. My goal is to help you reduce waste and lower your monthly cloud spend without sacrificing performance or reliability.
