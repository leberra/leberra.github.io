Leberra is a consultancy founded to help modern technology companies build secure, automated, and observable cloud
platforms.

My name is Garrett Leber. With my background as a Senior DevOps Engineer and a former US Air Force Network Security
Analyst, I bring a unique, security-first mindset to every project. My expertise is focused on two core areas:

**1. Secure Platform Engineering:** I design and build production-grade Kubernetes platforms using Infrastructure as
Code (IaC) and GitOps principles. I don't just build platforms; I build secure, resilient, and easy-to-manage ecosystems
that empower your development teams. My expertise with Terraform, ArgoCD, and Helm ensures your infrastructure is a
solid foundation for growth.

**2. Cloud-Native Observability:** A modern platform is incomplete without the ability to understand it. I help you go
beyond basic metrics by implementing comprehensive observability strategies using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and
OpenTelemetry. My focus is on creating actionable insights, optimizing your monitoring spend, and building systems that
help you resolve incidents faster.

I believe in empowering my clients and the community. That's why I contribute to open-source projects and share my
knowledge. If you're ready to build a secure and scalable cloud environment, please reach out to
